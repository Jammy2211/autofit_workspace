A description of the general.ini config.

[output]
    log_every_update : int
        The number of new maximum likelihood models that must be sampled for PyAutoLens to log the results to the 
        Python interpreter. A log_every_update of -1 turns off logging.
    log_file : str
        The file name the logged output is written to (in the phase folder).
    log_level : str
        The level of logging.
    backup_every_update : int
        The number of new maximum likelihood models that must be sampled for PyAutoLens to backup the
        results to the samples_backup folder of the phase. A backup_every_update of -1 turns off backups.
    grid_results_interval : int
        For a GridSearch non-linear optimization this interval sets after how many samples on the grid output is
        performed for. A grid_results_interval of -1 turns off output.
    model_results_every_update : int
        The number of new maximum likelihood models that must be sampled for PyAutoLens to output a new model.results
        file using the latest MultiNest samples and thus most up to data PDFs. A model_results_every_update of -1
        turns off backups.
    model_results_decimal_places : int
        The number of decimal places the estimate values and errors of all parameters in the model.results file are
        output to.
    remove_files : bool
        If True, all output files of a phase (e.g. samples, samples_backup, model.results, images, etc.) are
        deleted once the phase has completed.
        A .zip file of all output is always written at the phase before files are removed, thus results are not lost
        with this option turned on. If a PyAutoLens does not find the output files of a phase (because they were
        removed) but does find its .zip file, it will unzip the contents and continue the analysis as if the files were
        there all along.
        This feature was implemented because super-computers often have a limit on the number of files allowed per
        user and the large number of files output by PyAutoLens can exceed this limit. By removing files the
        number of files is restricted only to the .zip files.
