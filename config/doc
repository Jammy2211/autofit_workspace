A general description of configs in PyAutoLens is provided here, checkout their associated doc file for a more
 detailed description of every config.

general.ini:
    Customizes general PyAutoLens settings such as the frequency of logging and backing up,

priors:
    Customize the priors of every model-component in your project (see doc_priors).

    default:
        The default priors used on every model component in PyAutoLens (e.g. light proiles, mass profiles, etc.), for
        example if they use a UniformPrior or GausssianPrior and the range of values sampled.
    limit:
        The limits between which a parameter may be sampled. For example, the axis_ratio of light and mass profiles has
        limits 0.0 -> 1.0 to prevent unphysical models.
    width:
        The width of the GaussianPrior used for each parameter if its priors are initialized via linking from a previous
        phase.


visualize:
    general.ini:
        General visualization setting like the matplotlib backend and what features should be included on an image (e.g.
        the critical curves, origin, mask, etc.)


non-Linear:
    Customize the default `NonLinearSearch` settings used by PyAutoLens (see doc_non_linear).


label.ini:
    The labels used for every model parameter on certain figures (e.g. the label for centres are y an x and for an
    axis ratio is q).

label_format.ini:
    The format of certain results output by PyAutoLens (e.g. the mass format is {:.4e}, meaning it is output as an
    exponential to 4 dp).
