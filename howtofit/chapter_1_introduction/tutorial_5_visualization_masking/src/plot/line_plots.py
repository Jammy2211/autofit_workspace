To visualize images during a phase, we need to be able to output them to hard-disk as a file (e.g a .png'). The line
plot function below has been extended to provide this functionality.

    ----------
    xvalues : ndarray
        The x-coordinates the profile is defined on.
    line : ndarray
        The intensity values of the profile which are plotted.

    output_path : str
        The path the image is to be output to hard-disk as a .png.
    output_filename : str
        The filename of the file if it is output as a .png.
    output_format : str
        Determines where the plot is displayed on your screen ("show") or output to the hard-disk as a png ("png").
