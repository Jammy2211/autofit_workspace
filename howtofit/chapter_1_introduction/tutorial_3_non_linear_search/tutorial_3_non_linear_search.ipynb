    "Okay, so its finally time to take our model and fit it to our data, hurrah!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we infer the parameters for a Gaussian that that give a good fit to our dataset?  In the last tutorial, we tried a very basic approach, randomly guessing models until we found one that gave a good fit and high likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed that this wasn't really a viable strategy for more complex models, and it isn't. Surprisisngly, however, this is the basis of how model fitting actually works! Basically, our model-fitting algorithm guesses lots of models, tracking the likelihood of these models. As the algorithm progresses, it begins to guess more models using parameter combinations that gave higher likelihood solutions previously, with the idea that if a set of parameters provided a good fit to the dataset, a model with similar values probably will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a 'non-linear search' and its a fairly common problem faced by scientists. We're going to use a non-linear search algorithm called 'MultiNest'. For now, lets not worry about the details of how MultiNest actually works. Instead, just picture that a non-linear search in PyAutoFit operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Randomly guess a model and map its parameters via the priors to make an instance of a Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use this model instance to generate a model image and compare this model image to the imaging data to compute a likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat this many times, using the likelihoods of previous fits (typically those with a high likelihood) to guide us to the lens models with the highest likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 2, we'll go into the details of how a non-linear search works and outline the benefits and drawbacks of different non-linear search algorithms. In this chapter, we just want to convince ourselves that we can fit a model!"
