The ``projects`` contains example projects which use **PyAutoFit** to perform modeling.

They show how one would build a structure a project around **PyAutoFit** to best use its tools for model-composition, model-fitting, visualization, etc.

They also demonstrate advanced functionality using real-world examples.

- ``cosmology``: Example **PyAutoFit** project using a model-fitting example from Astronomy. This highlights **multi-level models**.
