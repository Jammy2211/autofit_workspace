Project: Cosmology
==================

This project uses the astrophysical phenomena of Strong Gravitational Lensing to illustrate multi-level model
composition and fitting with **PyAutoFit**.

A strong gravitational lens is a system where two (or more) galaxies align perfectly down our line of sight from Earth
such that the foreground galaxy's mass deflects the light of a background source galaxy(s).

When the alignment is just right and the lens is massive enough, the background source galaxy appears multiple
times. The schematic below shows such a system, where light-rays from the source are deflected around the lens galaxy
to the observer following multiple distinct paths.

As an observer, we don't see the source's true appearance (e.g. the red round blob of light). We only observe its
light after it has been deflected and lensed by the foreground galaxies (e.g. as the two distinct red multiple images
 in the image on the left). We also observe the emission of the foreground galaxy (in blue).

__PyAutoLens__

Strong gravitational lensing is the original science case that sparked the development of **PyAutoFit**, which is
a spin off of our astronomy software **PyAutoLens** `https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens`.

We'll use **PyAutoLens** to illustrate how the tools we developed with **PyAutoFit** allowed us to
ensure **PyAutoLens**'s model fitting tools were extensible, easy to maintain and enabled intuitive model composition.

__Multi-Level Models__

Strong lensing is a great case study for using **PyAutoFit**, due to the multi-component nature of how one composes
a strong lens model. A strong lens model consists of light and mass models of each galaxy in the lens system, where
each galaxy is a model in itself. The galaxies are combined into one overall "lens model", which in later tutorials
we will show may also have a Cosmological model.

This example project uses **PyAutoFit** to compose and fit models of a strong lens, in particular highlighting
**PyAutoFits** multi-level model composition.

__Strong Lens Modeling__

The models are fitted to Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a real strong lens system and will allow us to come up
with a description of how light is deflected on its path through the Universe.

This project consists of two example scripts / notebooks:

 1) `example_1_intro`: An introduction to strong lensing, and the various parts of the project's source code that are
    used to represent a strong lens galaxy.

 2) `example_2_multi_level_model`: Using **PyAutoFit** to model a strong lens, with a strong emphasis on the
    multi-level model API.

__This Example__

This introduction primarily focuses on what strong lensing is, how we define the individual model-components and fit
a strong lens model to data. It does not make much use of **PyAutoFit**, but it does provide a clear understanding of
the model so that **PyAutoFit**'s use in example 2 is clear.

Note that import `import src as cosmo`. The package `src` contains all the code we need for this example Cosmology
use case, and can be thought of as the source-code you would write to perform model-fitting via **PyAutoFit** for your
problem of interest.

The module `src/__init__.py` performs a series of imports that are used throughout this lecture to provide convenient
access to different parts of the source code.
"""
# %matplotlib inline
# from pyprojroot import here
# workspace_path = str(here())
# %cd $workspace_path
# print(f"Working Directory has been set to `{workspace_path}`")

import src as cosmo
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy import signal
from os import path

"""
__Plot__

We will plot a lot of arrays of 2D data and grids of 2D coordinates in this example, so lets make a convenience 
functions.
"""


def plot_array(array, title=None, norm=None):
    plt.imshow(array, norm=norm)
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()
    plt.close()


def plot_grid(grid, title=None):
    plt.scatter(x=grid[:, :, 0], y=grid[:, :, 1], s=1)
    plt.title(title)
    plt.show()
    plt.close()


"""
__Data__

First, lets load and plot Hubble Space Telescope imaging data of the strong gravitational lens called SDSSJ2303+1422, 
where this data includes:
 
 1) The image of the strong lens, which is the data we'll fit.
 2) The noise in every pixel of this image, which will be used when evaluating the log likelihood.

__Masking__

When fitting 2D imaging data, it is common to apply a mask which removes regions of the image that are not relevant to
the model fitting.

For example, when fitting the strong lens, we remove the edges of the image where the lens and source galaxy's light is 
not visible.

In the strong lens image and noise map below, you can see this has already been performed, with the edge regions
blank.
"""
dataset_path = path.join("projects", "cosmology", "dataset")

data = np.load(file=path.join(dataset_path, "data.npy"))
plot_array(array=data, title="Image of Strong Lens SDSSJ2303+1422")

noise_map = np.load(file=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.npy"))
plot_array(array=noise_map, title="Noise Map of Strong Lens SDSSJ2303+1422")

"""
In the image of the strong lens two distinct objects can be seen:

 1) A central blob of light, corresponding to the foreground lens galaxy whose mass is responsible for deflecting light.
 2) Two faint arcs of light in the bakcground, which is the lensed background source.
 
__PSF__

Another component of imaging data is the Point Spread Function (PSF), which describes how the light of the galaxies
are blurred when they enter the Huble Space Telescope's. 

This is because diffraction occurs when the light enters HST's optics, causing the light to smear out. The PSF is
a two dimensional array that describes this blurring via a 2D convolution kernel.

When fitting the data below and in the `log_likelihood_function`, you'll see that the PSF is used when creating the 
model data. This is an example of how an `Analysis` class may be extended to include additional steps in the model
fitting procedure.
"""
psf = np.load(file=path.join(dataset_path, "psf.npy"))
plot_array(array=psf, title="Point Spread Function of Strong Lens SDSSJ2303+1422")


""" 
__Grid__
 
To perform strong lensing, we need a grid of (x,y) coordinates which we map throughout the Universe as if their path
is deflected. 

For this, we create a simple 2D grid of coordinates below where the origin is (0.0, 0.0) and the size of
a pixel is 0.05, which corresponds to the resolution of our image `data`. 

This grid only contains (y,x) coordinates within the cricular mask that was applied to the data, as we only need to
perform ray-tracing within this region.
"""
grid = np.load(file=path.join(dataset_path, "grid.npy"))

plot_grid(
    grid=grid,
    title="Cartesian grid of (x,y) coordinates aligned with strong lens dataset",
)

"""
__Light Profiles__

Our model of a strong lens must include a description of the light of each galaxy, which we call a "light profile".
In the source-code of this example project, specifically the module `src/light_profiles.py` you will see there
are two light profile classes named `LightDeVaucouleurs` and `LightExponential`.

These Python classes are the model components we will use to represent each galaxy's light and they behave analogous 
to the `Gaussian` class seen in other tutorials. The input parameters of their `__init__` constructor (e.g. `centre`, 
`axis_ratio`, `angle`) are their model parameters that may be fitted for by a non-linear search.

These classes also contain functions which create an image from the light profile if an input grid of (x,y) 2D 
coordinates are input, which we use below to create an image of a light profile.
"""
light_profile = cosmo.lp.LightExponential(
    centre=(0.01, 0.01), axis_ratio=0.7, angle=45.0, intensity=1.0, effective_radius=2.0
)
light_image = light_profile.image_from_grid(grid=grid)

plot_array(array=light_image, title="Image of an Exponential light profile.")

"""
__Mass Profiles__

Our model also includes the mass of the foreground lens galaxy, called a 'mass profile'. In the source-code of the 
example project, specifically the module `src/mass_profiles.py` you will see there is a mass profile class named 
`MassIsothermal`. Like the light profile, this will be a model-component **PyAutoFit** fits via a non-linear search.

The class also contains functions which create the "deflections angles", which describe the angles by which light is 
deflected when it passes the mass of the foreground lens galaxy. These are subtracted from the (y,x) grid above to
determine the original coordinates of the source galaxy before lensing.

A higher mass galaxy, which bends light more, will have higher values of the deflection angles plotted below:
"""
mass_profile = cosmo.mp.MassIsothermal(
    centre=(0.01, 0.01), axis_ratio=0.7, angle=45.0, mass=0.5
)
mass_deflections = mass_profile.deflections_from_grid(grid=grid)

plot_array(
    array=mass_deflections[:, :, 0],
    title="X-component of the deflection angles of a Isothermal mass profile.",
)
plot_array(
    array=mass_deflections[:, :, 1],
    title="Y-component of the deflection angles of a Isothermal mass profile.",
)

"""
__Ray Tracing__

The deflection angles describe how our (x,y) grid of coordinates are deflected by the mass of the foreground galaxy.

We can therefore ray-trace the grid aligned with SDSSJ2303+1422 using the mass profile above and plot a grid of
coordinates in the reference frame of before their light is gravitationally lensed:
"""
traced_grid = grid - mass_deflections

plot_grid(grid=traced_grid, title="Cartesian grid of (x,y) traced coordinates.")

"""
By inputting this traced grid of (x,y) coordinates into our light profile, we can create an image of the galaxy as if
it were gravitationally lensed by the mass profile.
"""
traced_light_image = light_profile.image_from_grid(grid=traced_grid)

plot_array(
    array=traced_light_image,
    title="Image of a gravitationally lensed Exponential light profile.",
)

"""
__Galaxy__

In the `src/galaxy.py` module we define the `Galaxy` class, which is a collection of light and mass profiles at an 
input redshift. For strong lens modeling, we have to use `Galaxy` objects, as the redshifts define how ray-tracing is
performed.

Below, we create two instances of the `Galaxy` class, representing the lens and source galaxies in a strong lens system.
"""
light_profile = cosmo.lp.LightDeVaucouleurs(
    centre=(0.01, 0.01), axis_ratio=0.9, angle=45.0, intensity=0.1, effective_radius=1.0
)
mass_profile = cosmo.mp.MassIsothermal(
    centre=(0.01, 0.01), axis_ratio=0.7, angle=45.0, mass=0.8
)
lens_galaxy = cosmo.Galaxy(
    redshift=0.5, light_profile_list=[light_profile], mass_profile_list=[mass_profile]
)

light_profile = cosmo.lp.LightExponential(
    centre=(0.1, 0.1), axis_ratio=0.5, angle=80.0, intensity=1.0, effective_radius=5.0
)
source_galaxy = cosmo.Galaxy(
    redshift=0.5, light_profile_list=[light_profile], mass_profile_list=[mass_profile]
)

"""
A galaxy's image is the sum of its light profile images, and its deflection angles are the sum of its mass profile
deflection angles.

To illustrate this, lets plot the lens galaxy's light profile image:
"""
galaxy_image = lens_galaxy.image_from_grid(grid=grid)

plot_array(array=galaxy_image, title="Image of the Lens Galaxy.")

"""
__Data Fitting__

We can create an overall image of the strong lens by:

 1) Creating an image of the lens galaxy.
 2) Computing the deflection angles of the lens galaxy.
 3) Ray-tracing light to the source galaxy reference frame and using its light profile to make its image.
"""
lens_image = lens_galaxy.image_from_grid(grid=grid)
lens_deflections = lens_galaxy.deflections_from_grid(grid=grid)

traced_grid = grid - lens_deflections

source_image = source_galaxy.image_from_grid(grid=traced_grid)

# The grid has zeros at its edges, which produce nans in the model image.
# These lead to an ill-defined log likelihood, so we set them to zero.
overall_image = np.nan_to_num(overall_image)

plot_array(array=overall_image, title="Image of the overall Strong Lens System.")

"""
__Model Data__

To produce the `model_data`, we now convolution the overall image with the Point Spread Function (PSF) of our
observations. This blurs the image to simulate the telescope optics and pixelization used to observe the image.
"""
model_data = signal.convolve2d(
            overall_image, psf, mode="same"
        )


plot_array(array=model_data, title="Image of the overall Strong Lens System.")

"""
By subtracting this model image from the data, we can create a 2D residual map. This is equivalent to the residual maps
we made in the 1D Gaussian examples, except for 2D imaging data.

Clearly, the random lens model we used in this example does not provide a good fit to SDSSJ2303+1422.
"""
residual_map = data - model_data

plot_array(array=residual_map, title="Residual Map of fit to SDSSJ2303+1422")

"""
Just like we did for the 1D `Gaussian` fitting examples, we can use the noise-map to compute the normalized residuals 
and chi-squared map of the lens model.
"""
# The circular masking introduces zeros at the edge of the noise-map,
# which can lead to divide-by-zero errors.
# We set these values to 1.0e8, to ensure they do not contribute to the log likelihood.
noise_map_fit = noise_map
noise_map_fit[noise_map == 0] = 1.0e8

normalized_residual_map = residual_map / noise_map_fit

chi_squared_map = (normalized_residual_map) ** 2.0

plot_array(
    array=normalized_residual_map,
    title="Normalized Residual Map of fit to SDSSJ2303+1422",
)
plot_array(array=chi_squared_map, title="Chi Squared Map of fit to SDSSJ2303+1422")

"""
Finally, we can compute the `log_likelihood` of this lens model, which we will use in the next example to fit the 
lens model to data with a non-linear search.
"""
chi_squared = np.sum(chi_squared_map)
noise_normalization = np.sum(np.log(2 * np.pi * noise_map**2.0))

log_likelihood = -0.5 * (chi_squared + noise_normalization)

print(log_likelihood)

"""
__Wrap Up__

In this example, we introduced the astrophysical phenomena of strong gravitational lensing, and gave an overview of how
one can create a model for a strong lens system and fit it to imaging data. 

We ended by defining the log likelihood of the model-fit, which will form the `log_likelihood_function` of the
`Analysis` class we use in the next example, which fits this strong lens using **PyAutoFit**.

There is one thing you should think about, how would we translate the above classes (e.g. `LightExponential`, 
`MassIsothermal` and `Galaxy`) using the **PyAutoFit** `Model` and `Collection` objects? The `Galaxy` class contained 
instances of the light and mass profile classes, meaning the standard use of the `Model` and `Collection` objects could 
not handle this.

This is where multi-level models come in, as will be shown in the next example!
