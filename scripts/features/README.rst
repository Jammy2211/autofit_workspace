The ``features`` folder contains example scripts for using advanced **PyAutoFit** features.

Files (Advanced)
----------------

- ``graphical_models.py``: Compose ansd fit graphical and hierarchical models to big datasets.
- ``interpolate.py``: Fit datasets which smoothly vary as a function of a continuous parameter (e.g. time) and interpolate between them.
- ``model_comparison.py``: Perform Bayesian model comparison between different models to determine which the data favours.
- ``search_chaining.py``: Chaining together multiple non-linear searches to automate the fitting of a complex model.
- ``search_grid_search.py``: Perform a massively parallel grid search of non-linear searches.
- ``sensitivity_mapping.py``: Determine how sensitive a dataset is to a model's complexity.
