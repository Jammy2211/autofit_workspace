"""
This is our dataset, which stores data containing a noisy 1D `Gaussian` with a noise-map.

Our data is a 1D numpy array of values corresponding to the observed counts of the Gaussian. The noise-map corresponds 
to the expected noise in every data point.

In PyAutoFit we use the term `Dataset` to represent the collection of data, noise-map, etc. that are fitted. For your 
model-fitting problem your `Dataset` is most likely more complex than this and could contain many additional 
components than just the `data` and `noise_map`.

In these tutorials we are calling our dataset class `Dataset`, as opposed to something more specific to the data
(e.g. `Line`). We advise that for your project the `Dataset` class is give a more specific name (e.g., if your 
`Dataset` is imaging data, the class may be called `Imaging`. If your `Dataset` is a spectrum, you may use `Spectrum`).

However, to make the tutorials generic, we've stuck with the name `Dataset` for clarity.

NOTE: Many methods in this module (those associated with trimming and Settings) are described in tutorial 3 of the
phase API chapter.

We use a `SettingsDataset` class to choose the settings of how our `Dataset` is setup for the model-fit. For this 
template project, these settings control just one aspect of the `Dataset`, how it is trimmed from the right and left
before model-fitting.

The `Settings` class includes tags, which customize the folders of the output of the phase. See tutorial 3 and the 
module, `settings.py` for a more complete description of tagging.
