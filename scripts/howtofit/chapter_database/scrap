Unlike the previous tutorial, the results of the non-linear search are output to hard-disk, by passing
a ``name`` and / or ``path_prefix`` attribute. These name the files and output folder the results are output to on
your hard-disk.

The benefits of doing this include:

- Inspecting results via folders on your computer is more efficient than using a Jupyter Notebook when you are
  fitting many datasets and models.

- Results are output on-the-fly, making it possible to check that a fit is progressing as expected mid way through.

- Unfinished runs can be resumed from where they left off if they are terminated.

Due to the increased complexity of our model, the model-fit takes longer to run and therefore being able to
inspect the fit during the run and resume it if it ends prematurely is advantageous.

Results are output every `iteration_per_update` to hard-disk, so we can inspect the results of the model-fit on-the-fly.
This takes a bit of time, so we only do it every 10000 iterations in this tutorial so it doesn't slow down the fit
noticeably.



__On-The-Fly Output__

Now the fit is running you should checkout the `autofit_workspace/output` folder. This is where the results of the
search are written to hard-disk (in the `howtofit/tutorial_4_why_modeling_is_hard` folder), where all outputs are human
readable (e.g. as .json, .csv or text files).

As the fit progresses, results are written to the `output` folder on the fly using the highest likelihood model found
by the non-linear search so far. This means you can inspect the results of the model-fit as it runs, without having to
wait for the non-linear search to terminate.

The `output` folder includes:

 - `model.info`: Summarizes the model, its parameters and their priors discussed in the next tutorial.

 - `model.results`: Summarizes the highest likelihood lens model inferred so far including errors.

 - `images`: Visualization of the highest likelihood model-fit to the dataset, (e.g. a fit subplot showing the lens
 and source galaxies, model data and residuals).

 - `files`: A folder containing human-readable .json file describing the model and search and  a `.csv` table of
   every non-linear search sample and other files containing information about the model-fit.

 - search.summary: A file providing summary statistics on the performance of the non-linear search.

 - `search_internal`: Internal files of the non-linear search (in this case Dynesty) used for resuming the fit and
  visualizing the search.

The `output` folder is therefore where you inspect the results of the model-fit on-the-fly and once the model-fit has
completed.
