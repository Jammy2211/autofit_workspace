"""
Adding a Model Component
========================

The `autofit_workspace` comes ready for fitting 1D `Gaussian` and `Exponential` profiles, complete with configuration
files, analysis classes and example scripts.

However, once you're familiar with **PyAutoFit**, you will want to add your own model-components, specific to your
model-fitting task. There are a couple of extra steps that come with doing this, associated with configuration files,
that this brief guide explains.

Adding a class
--------------

The model-component we are going to add will perform a `y = mx + c` linear fit to noisy data drawn from a straight
line. We're only going to focus on the steps necessary to add this new model component, so we'll omit writing an
`Analysis` class and performing the actual fit itself.
"""
# %matplotlib inline
# from pyprojroot import here
# workspace_path = str(here())
# %cd $workspace_path
# print(f"Working Directory has been set to `{workspace_path}`")

import autofit as af

"""
To perform a linear fit, we require a `LinearFit` model-component that fits the data with a 
line `y = mx + c` or equivalently `y = (gradient * x) + intercept`.
"""


class LinearFit:
    def __init__(self, gradient=1.0, intercept=0.0):

        self.gradient = gradient
        self.intercept = intercept

    def profile_from_xvalues(self, xvalues):

        return (self.gradient * xvalues) + self.intercept


"""
As should be clear on by now, the class `LinearFit` defines our model-component which has free parameters  `gradient` 
and `intercept`.

However, if we try to make this a `PriorModel` PyAutoFit raises an error (I've commented this out, but feel free to
uncomment the code and run it to see the error).

The error will read something like `KeyError: 'No prior config found for class LinearFit and path gradient 
in directories C:\\Users\\Jammy\\Code\\PyAuto\\autofit_workspace\\config\\priors'`
"""
# model = af.PriorModel(LinearFit)

"""
**PyAutoFit** is informing us that it cannot find prior configuration files for the `LinearFit` model-component and that 
they are therefore missing from the folder `autofit_workspace/config/priors`.

Every model-component must have a `.json` config file in the `autofit_workspace/config/priors` folder, so 
that **PyAutoFit** knows the default priors to associate with the model-component. If we do not manually override 
priors, these are the priors that will be used by default when a model-fit is performed.

Next, inspect the `TemplateObject.json` configuration file in `autofit_workspace/config/priors`. You should see
the following `.json` text:
"""
{
    "parameter0": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": 0.0, "upper_limit": 1.0},
    "parameter1": {
        "type": "Gaussian",
        "mean": 0.0,
        "sigma": 0.1,
        "lower_limit": "-inf",
        "upper_limit": "inf",
    },
}

"""
This specifies the default priors on two parameters, named `parameter0` and `parameter1`. The `type` is the type of 
prior assumed by **PyAutoFit** by default for its corresponding parameter. 

In the example above: 

- `parameter0` is given a `UniformPrior` with limits between 0.0 and 1.0. 
- `parameter1` a `GaussianPrior` with mean 0.0 and sigma 1.0.

The `lower_limit` and `upper_limit` of a `GaussianPrior` define the boundaries of what parameter values are 
physically allowed. If a model-component is given a value outside these limits during model-fitting the model is
instantly resampled and discarded.
 
We can easily adapt this template for our `LinearFit` model component. First, copy and paste the `TemplateObject.json`
file to create a new file called `LinearFit.json`. 

**PyAutoFit** matches the name of the class to the name of the configuration file, therefore it is a requirement that 
the configuration file is named `LinearFit.json`.

Next, rename `parameter0` to `gradient`, `parameter1` to `intercept` and make it so both assume a `UniformPrior` 
between -10.0 to 10.0.

The `.json` file should read as follows:

"""
{
    "gradient": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": -10.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
    "intercept": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": -10.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
}

"""
We should now be able to make a `PriorModel` of the `LinearFit` class.
"""
model = af.PriorModel(LinearFit)

"""
Adding a Module
---------------

For larger projects, it is not ideal to have to write all the model-component classes in a single Python script, 
especially as we may have many different model components. We instead would prefer them to be in their own dedicated 
Python module.

open the file:

- `autofit_workspace/scripts/overview/adding_a_model_component/linear_fit.py`  OR
- `autofit_workspace/notebooks/overview/adding_a_model_component/linear_fit.py`

Here, you will see the `LinearFit` class above is contained in the module `linear_fit.py`. There is also a `PowerFit` 
class, fits the function `y = m (x**p) + c`.

If we import this module and try to make a  `PriorModel` of the `linear_fit.LinearFit` or `linear_fit.PowerFit` 
classes, we receive the same configuration error as before.
"""
import linear_fit

# model = af.PriorModel(linear_fit.LinearFit)
# model = af.PriorModel(linear_fit.PowerFit)

"""
This is because if a model-component is contained in a Python module, the prior configuration file must be named after
that `module` and structured to contain Python class itself.

Open the file `autofit_workspace/config/priors/template_module.json`, which reads as follows:
"""
{
    "ModelComponent0": {
        "parameter0": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": 0.0, "upper_limit": 1.0},
        "parameter1": {"type": "LogUniform", "lower_limit": 1e-06, "upper_limit": 1e6},
        "parameter2": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": 0.0, "upper_limit": 25.0},
    },
    "ModelComponent1": {
        "parameter0": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": 0.0, "upper_limit": 1.0},
        "parameter1": {"type": "LogUniform", "lower_limit": 1e-06, "upper_limit": 1e6},
        "parameter2": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": 0.0, "upper_limit": 1.0},
    },
}

"""
This looks very similar to `TemplateObject`, the only differences are:

 - It now contains the model-component class name in the configuration file, e.g. `ModelComponent0`, `ModelComponent1`.
 - It includes multiple model-components, whereas `TemplateObject.json` corresponded to only one model component.
 
We can again easily adapt this template for our `linear_fit.py` module. Copy, paste and rename the `.json` file to
`linear_fit.json` (noting again that **PyAutoFit** matches the module name to the configuration file) and update the
parameters as follows:
"""
{
    "LinearFit": {
        "gradient": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": -10.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
        "intercept": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": -10.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
    },
    "PowerFit": {
        "gradient": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": -10.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
        "intercept": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": -10.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
        "power": {"type": "Uniform", "lower_limit": 0.0, "upper_limit": 10.0},
    },
}

"""
We are now able to create both the `linear_fit.LinearFit` and `linear_fit.PowerFit` objects as `PriorModel`'s.
"""
model = af.PriorModel(linear_fit.LinearFit)
model = af.PriorModel(linear_fit.PowerFit)

"""
Optional Configs
----------------

There are a couple more configuration files you can optionally update, which change how results are output. Open the 
following configuration files:

`autofit_workspace/config/notation/label.ini`
`autofit_workspace/config/notation/label_format.ini`


These configuration files include the following additional settings for our model components:

`label_ini` -> [label]: 
   This is a short-hand label for each parameter of each model-component used by certain **PyAutoFit** output files.

`label_ini` -> [subscript]: 
   A subscript for the model-component used by certain **PyAutoFit** output files.

`label_format.ini` -> [format]
   The format that the values of a parameter appear in the `model.results` file.


For our `LinearFit` update the `label.ini` config as follows:

[label]
centre=x
intensity=I
sigma=sigma
rate=\lambda
gradient=m
intercept=c
power=p

[subscript]
Gaussian=g
Exponential=e
LinearFit=lin
PowerFit=pow

and `label_format.ini` as:

[format]
centre={:.2f}
intensity={:.2f}
sigma={:.2f}
rate={:.2f}
gradient={:.2f}
intercept={:.2f}
power={:.2f}

You should now be able to add your own model-components to your **PyAutoFit** project!
