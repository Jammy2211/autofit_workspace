"""
The `Gaussian` class in this module is the model components that is fitted to data using a non-linear search. The
inputs of its __init__ constructor are the parameters which can be fitted for.

The log_likelihood_function in the Analysis class receives an instance of this classes where the values of its
parameters have been set up according to the non-linear search. Because instances of the classes are used, this means
their methods (e.g. profile_from_xvalues) can be used in the log likelihood function.
