        "This cookbook illustrates how to fit multiple datasets simultaneously, where each dataset is fitted by a different\n",

        "\n",
        "The `Analysis` classes are summed together to give an overall log likelihood function that is the sum of the\n",
        "individual log likelihood functions, which a single model is fitted to via non-linear search.\n",
        "\n",
        "If one has multiple observations of the same signal, it is often desirable to fit them simultaneously. This ensures\n",
        "that better constraints are placed on the model, as the full amount of information in the datasets is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some scenarios, the signal may vary across the datasets in a way that requires that the model is updated\n",
        "accordingly. **PyAutoFit** provides tools to customize the model composition such that specific parameters of the model\n",
        "vary across the datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "This cookbook illustrates using observations of 3 1D Gaussians, which have the same `centre` (which is the same\n",
        "for the model fitted to each dataset) but different `normalization and `sigma` values (which vary for the model\n",
        "fitted to each dataset).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is common for each individual dataset to only constrain specific aspects of a model. The high level of model\n",
        "customization provided by **PyAutoFit** ensures that composing a model that is appropriate for fitting large and diverse\n",
