        "For small model-fitting tasks this is sufficient, however it does not scale well when performing many model fits to \n",
        "large datasets, because manual inspection of results becomes time consuming.\n",
        "\n",
        "All results can therefore be output to an sqlite3 (https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) relational database,\n",
        "meaning that results can be loaded into a Jupyter notebook or Python script for inspection, analysis and interpretation. \n",
