        "At the heart of model-fitting is the model: a set of equations, numerical processes, and assumptions describing a\n",
        "physical system of interest. The goal of model-fitting is to better understand this physical system and develop\n",
        "predictive models that describe it more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "In astronomy, a model might describe the distribution of stars within a galaxy. In biology, it might represent the\n",
        "interaction of proteins within a cell. In finance, it could describe the evolution of stock prices in a market.\n",
        "Regardless of the field, the model acts as a mathematical description of the physical system, aiming to enhance\n",
        "understanding and enable new predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whatever your model, its equations are defined by \"free parameters.\" Changing these parameters alters the\n",
        "behavior and predictions of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the model is defined and parameter values are chosen, the model creates \"model data\"\u2014a realization of how the\n",
        "physical system appears given those parameters. This process, often referred to as \"forward modeling,\" describes the\n",
        "physical system from its starting point and predicts the data we observe.\n",
        "\n",
        "By varying the model parameters, we can generate numerous model datasets. The ultimate goal of model-fitting, which\n",
        "you will learn by the end of this chapter, is to determine the model parameters and corresponding dataset that best\n",
        "fit the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Astronomy Example__\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Multiple parameters defining their distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Several parameters describing their colors.\n",
        "\n",
        "If our model pertains to the distribution of stars within a galaxy, the forward model will produce an image of what\n",
        "that galaxy looks like when observed with a telescope. This forward model might account for physical effects such as\n",
        "the blurring of light due to diffraction in the telescope optics.\n",
        "\n",
        "By altering the parameters describing the stars, we can generate many different model images via this forward model.\n",
        "\n",
