        "========================\n",
        "\n",
        "We've learned that a model consists of equations, numerical processes, and assumptions that describe a physical system.\n",
        "Using **PyAutoFit**, we defined simple 1D models like the Gaussian, composed them into models using `Model` and\n",
        "`Collection` objects, and generated model data by varying their parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "To apply our model to real-world situations, we must fit it to data. Fitting involves assessing how well the model\n",
        "matches observed data. A good fit indicates that the model's parameter values accurately describe the physical system.\n",
        "Conversely, a poor fit suggests that adjustments are needed to better reflect reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model-fitting is a cyclical process: define the model, fit it to data, and refine the model based on insights gained.\n",
        "Iteratively improving the model's complexity enhances its ability to accurately represent the system under study.\n",
        "This iterative process lies at the core of model-fitting in scientific analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Astronomy Example__\n",
        "\n",
        "In Astronomy, this process has been crucial for understanding the distributions of stars within galaxies. By\n",
        "fitting high-quality images of galaxies with increasingly sophisticated models, astronomers have determined that\n",
        "stars within galaxies are organized into structures such as disks, bars, and bulges. This approach has also revealed\n",
        "that stars appear differently in red and blue images due to variations in their age and composition.\n",

        "__Overview__\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will explore how to fit the `model_data` generated by a model to actual data. Specifically, we will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Load data representing a 1D Gaussian signal, which serves as our target dataset for fitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Compute quantities such as residuals by subtracting the model data from the observed data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Quantitatively assess the goodness-of-fit using a critical measure in model-fitting known as the `log_likelihood`.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Data**: Load and plot the 1D Gaussian dataset we will fit.\n",
        "- **Model Data**: Generate model data of the `Gaussian` model using a forward model.\n",
        "- **Residuals**: Compute and visualize residuals between the model data and observed data.\n",
        "- **Normalized Residuals**: Compute and visualize normalized residuals, which account for the noise properties of the data.\n",
        "- **Chi Squared**: Compute and visualize the chi-squared map, a measure of the overall goodness-of-fit.\n",
        "- **Noise Normalization**: Compute the noise normalization term which describes the noise properties of the data.\n",
        "- **Likelihood**: Compute the log likelihood, a key measure of the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data.\n",
        "- **Fitting Models**: Fit the `Gaussian` model to the 1D data and compute the log likelihood, by guessing parameters.\n",
        "- **Extensibility**: Use the `Collection` object for fitting models with multiple components.\n",
