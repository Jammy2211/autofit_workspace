        "At the heart of model-fitting is the model: a set of equations, numerical processes and assumptions describing a\n",

        "develop more complex models which describe more aspects of the system more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Astronomy, a model may describe the distribution of stars within a galaxy. In biology, is may describe the\n",
        "interaction of proteins within a cell. In finance, it may describe the evolution of stock prices in a market.\n",
        "Your model depends on your topic of study, but in all cases the model acts as the mathematical description of\n",
        "some physical system you seek understand better, and hope ultimately to make new predictions of.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whatever your model, the equations that underpin will be defined by \"free parameters\". Changing these parameters\n",
        "changes the prediction of the model.\n",

        "For example, an Astronomy model of the distribution of stars may contain a\n",
        "parameter describing the brightness of the stars, a second parameter defining their number density and a third\n",
        "parameter describing their colors. If we multiplied the parameter describribing the brightness of the stars by 2,\n",
        "the stars would therefore appear twice as bright.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the model (e.g. the undrlying equations) is defined and a values for the free parameters have been chosen, the\n",
        "model can create \"model data\". This data is a realization of how the physical system appears for that model with\n",
        "those parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a model of the distribution of stars within a galaxy can be used to create a model image of that galaxy.\n",

        "different brightness, colors, sizes, etc.\n",

        "In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of defining a model, and we will in particular:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Define a simple model, described by few single equations.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Show that this model is described by 3 or more free parameters.\n",

        " - Use the model, with different sets of parameters, to generate model data.\n",
