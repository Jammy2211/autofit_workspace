        "In the previous tutorials, we laid the groundwork by defining a model and manually fitting it to data using fitting\n",
        "functions. We quantified the goodness of fit using the log likelihood and demonstrated that for models with only a few\n",
        "free parameters, we could achieve satisfactory fits by manually guessing parameter values. However, as the complexity\n",
        "of our models increased, this approach quickly became impractical.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will delve into a more systematic approach for fitting models to data. This technique is designed\n",

        "\n",
        "In mathematics, a function is defined by its parameters, which relate inputs to outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a simple function:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ f(x) = x^2 \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, \\( x \\) is the parameter input into the function \\( f \\), and \\( f(x) \\) returns \\( x^2 \\). This\n",
        "mapping between \\( x \\) and \\( f(x) \\) defines the \"parameter space\" of the function, which in this case is a parabola.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions can have multiple parameters, such as \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ f(x, y, z) = x + y^2 - z^3 \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the mapping between \\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( z \\), and \\( f(x, y, z) \\) defines a parameter space with three\n",
        "dimensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This concept of a parameter space relates closely to how we define and use instances of models in model-fitting.\n",
        "For instance, in our previous tutorial, we used instances of a 1D Gaussian profile with\n",
        "parameters \\( (x, I, \\sigma) \\) to fit data and compute a log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process can be thought of as complete analogous to a function \\( f(x, y, z) \\), where the output value is the\n",
        "log likelihood. This key function, which maps parameter values to a log likelihood, is called the \"likelihood function\"\n",
        "in statistical inference, albeit we will refer to it hereafter as the `log_likelihood_function` to be explicit\n",
        "that it is the log of the likelihood function.\n",
        "\n",
        "By expressing the likelihood in this manner, we can consider our model as having a parameter space -\u2014 a\n",
        "multidimensional surface that spans all possible values of the model parameters \\( x, I, \\sigma \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "This surface is often referred to as the \"likelihood surface\", and our objective during model-fitting is to find\n",
        "its peak.\n",
        "\n",
        "This parameter space is \"non-linear\", meaning the relationship between the input parameters and the log likelihood\n",
        "does not behave linearly. This non-linearity implies that we cannot predict the log likelihood from a set of model\n",
        "parameters without actually performing a fit to the data by performing the forward model calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Non-Linear Search__\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we understand our problem in terms of a non-linear parameter space with a likelihood surface, we can\n",
        "introduce the method used to fit the model to the data\u2014the \"non-linear search\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Previously, our approach involved manually guessing models until finding one with a good fit and high log likelihood.\n",
        "Surprisingly, this random guessing forms the basis of how model-fitting using a non-linear search actually works!\n",
        "\n",
        "A non-linear search involves systematically guessing many models while tracking their log likelihoods. As the\n",
        "algorithm progresses, it tends to favor models with parameter combinations that have previously yielded higher\n",
        "log likelihoods. This iterative refinement helps to efficiently explore the vast parameter space.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two key differences between guessing random models and using a non-linear search:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Computational Efficiency**: The non-linear search can evaluate the log likelihood of a model parameter\n",
        "  combinations in milliseconds and therefore many thousands of models in minutes. This computational speed enables\n",
        "  it to thoroughly sample potential solutions, which would be impractical for a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Effective Sampling**: The search algorithm maintains a robust memory of previously guessed models and their log\n",
        "  likelihoods. This allows it to sample potential solutions more thoroughly and converge on the highest\n",
        "  likelihood solutions more efficiently, which is again impractical for a human.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of the non-linear search as systematically exploring parameter space to pinpoint regions with the highest log\n",
        "likelihood values. Its primary goal is to identify and converge on the parameter values that best describe the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Search Types__\n",
        "\n",
        "There are different types of non-linear searches, each of which explores parameter space in a unique way.\n",
        "In this example, we will use three types of searches, which broadly represent the various approaches to non-linear\n",
        "searches used in statistical inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: This method aims to find the model that maximizes the likelihood function.\n",
        "  It does so by testing nearby models and adjusting parameters in the direction that increases the likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: This approach uses a group of \"walkers\" that explore parameter space randomly.\n",
        "  The likelihood at each walker's position influences the probability of the walker moving to a new position.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Nested Sampling**: This technique samples points from the parameter space iteratively. Lower likelihood points\n",
        "  are replaced by higher likelihood ones, gradually concentrating the samples in regions of high likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will provide more details on each of these searches below.\n",
        "\n",

        "Firstly, consider the speed of the fit regardless of the search method. If the fitting process runs efficiently, \n",
        "nested sampling could be advantageous for low-dimensional parameter spaces due to its ability to handle complex \n",
        "parameter spaces and its built-in stopping criterion. However, in high-dimensional scenarios, MCMC may be more \n",
        "suitable, as it scales better with the number of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, evaluate whether you have access to a robust starting point for your model fit. A strong initialization can \n",
        "make MCMC more appealing, allowing the algorithm to bypass the initial sampling stage and leading to quicker convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, think about the importance of error estimation in your analysis. If error estimation is not a priority, \n",
        "MLE might suffice, but this approach heavily relies on having a solid starting point and may struggle with more complex models.\n",

        "Ultimately, every model-fitting problem is unique, making it impossible to provide a one-size-fits-all answer regarding \n",

        "It helps in identifying the best-fit parameters that maximize the likelihood of the model given the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Non-linear Search**: This is an optimization technique used to explore the parameter space and find the \n",

        "likelihood. Many different search algorithms exist, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and this tutorial\n",
        "used the MLE, MCMC, and nested sampling searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Priors**: Priors are probabilities assigned to different values of parameters before considering the data. \n",
