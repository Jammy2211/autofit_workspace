        "\n",
        "1) By fitting each dataset one-by-one this means that each model-fit fails to fully exploit the information we know \n",
        "about the global model. We know that there are only two single shared values of `centre` across the full dataset \n",
        "that we want to estimate. However, each individual fit has its own `centre` value which is able to assume different \n",
        "values than the `centre` values used to fit the other datasets. This means that large degeneracies between the two \n",
        "centres are present in each model-fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "By not fitting our model as a global model, we do not maximize the amount of information that we can extract from the \n",
        "dataset as a whole. If a model fits dataset 1 poorly, this should be reflected in how we interpret how well the model \n",
        "fits datasets 2 and 3. Our non-linear search should have a global view of how well the model fits the whole dataset. \n",
        "This is the crucial aspect of fitting each dataset individually that we miss, and what a graphical model addresses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) When we combined the result to estimate the global `centre` value via a weighted average, we marginalized over \n",
        "the samples in 1D. As showed above, when there are strong degeneracies between models parameters the information on \n",
        "the covariance between these parameters is lost when computing the global `centre`. This increases the inferred \n",
        "uncertainties. A graphical model performs no such 1D marginalization and therefore fully samples the\n",
        "parameter covariances.\n",
        " \n",
        "3) In Bayesian inference it is important that we define priors on all of the model parameters. By estimating the \n",
        "global `centre` after the model-fits are completed it is unclear what prior the global `centre` actually has! We\n",
        "actually defined the prior five times -- once for each fit -- which is not a well defined prior. In a graphical model \n",
