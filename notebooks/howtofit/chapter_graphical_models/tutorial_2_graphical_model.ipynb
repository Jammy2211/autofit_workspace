    "In the previous tutorial, we fitted a dataset containing 3 noisy 1D Gaussian which had a shared and global value of\n",
    "`centre`. We attempted to estimate this global `centre` value by fitting each dataset individually with a 1D `Gaussian`. \n",
    "We then combined the inferred `centre` values of each fit to estimate the global `centre`, by either taking the mean \n",
    "values of each `centre` or combining the fits into a joint PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We concluded that estimating the global `centre` in these ways was suboptimal, and that we were better of fitting for\n",
    "the global `centre` in our model by fitting all 3 datasets simultaneously. In this tutorial we will do this by \n",
