    "Tutorial 3: Phase Customization\n",
    "===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to use the `Settings` object of our `Phase` object to customize the analysis. we'll use\n",
    "the specific example of two input parameters that trim our `Dataset` from the left and right before fitting it. This\n",
    "example is somewhat trivial, but it will serve to illustrate `Phase` settings and customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we customize a `Phase`, we'll use `SettingsPhase` to perform `tagging`. Here, we `tag` the output\n",
    "path of the `Phase`'s `Result`'s, such that every time a `Phase` is run with a different customization a new set of\n",
    "unique `Result`'s are stored for those `PhaseSetting`'s. For a given `Dataset` we are thus able to fit it multiple\n",
    "times using different settings to compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These new features have led to an additional module in the `phase` package called `settings.py`, as well as extensions\n",
    "to the `dataset.py` module. Before looking at these modules, lets first perform a series of `Emcee` fits to see how\n",
    "they change the behaviour of **PyAutoFit**."
